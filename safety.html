            <ul>
                <li><p>Before starting training check with the doctor first, an orthopedist and a cardiologist. Kettlebell training can be exceptionally intense.</p></li>
                <li><p>Always be aware of your surroundings. Train on a flat surface on which you can drop the kettlebell without worrying about it. Make sure, your line of fire is clear. If your kettlebell slips out of your hand, in the worst case scenario, it does not hit anybody or breaks something. Always be aware where the sun is. Be aware!</p></li>
                <li><p>Wear flat sole shoes (no sneakers with cushion) or go barefoot. Recommended shoes: converse, chuck taylors, wrestling shoes, etc.</p></li>
                <li><p>Never contest for space with the kettlebell. If the kettlebell wants to fall, get out of the way, do not fight it, let it go. Always remember: quick feet are happy feet!</p></li>
                <li><p>Practice all safety measures at all times, even with very light kettlebell. Always pose the question for yourself: would I be willing to do this with a 48kg kettlebell? If the answer is no, then don’t do that. Mentally stay with the set until you release the kettlebell. At the last rep lower the kettlebell as you plan to do another rep, then set the kettlebell down. Only then you may relax.</p></li>
                <li><p>Keep moving once your heart rate is high. When you've done a really hard set of swings or snaches do not just collapse to the ground, but keep moving! Walk, jug, shadowbox, it is going to make it easier on your heart.</p></li>
                <li><p>Build up the training load gradually using common sense and listen to your body. Do not follow a workout blindly if you are just learning the movement or you are not strong enough yet. While you are at it, practice other exercises to gain strength and endurance. You MUST listen to your body!</p></li>
                <li><p>Instruction can’t cover all contingencies. There is no substitute for good judgement. If you do not have good judgement, you should stay with the fitness machines.</p></li>
