            <p>Welcome! You made the first step to meet us. Below we collected all information which will help you to prepare for your first session with LKC.</p>
            <p>The below information is not the usual T&C, it is your best interest to read it.</p>
            <ul class="list-with-header">
                <li>
                    <p>Clothing</p>
                    <p>During training wear a comfortable training short or sweatpants, one in which you can confortably squat down to the lowest point.</p>
                    <p>On upperbody wear a t-shirt or jersey, in which you can lift your arms all the way up.</p>
                    <p>Your shoes must be flat sole, withou ankle support.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Eating, drinking</p>
                    <p>Bring a bottle of water with you, because you might want to drink during breaks.</p>
                    <p>You should consume your last meal at least one hour before the training start. The best state is emty stomach, but not hungry, because some excercise requires strong contraction of the abdomen part.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Attention</p>
                    <p>During your first class, as well as along the first 3 months, you will get more attention from the coach to ramp up your skills. To learn kettlebell specific movements you will get all the help needed. You might incline to hide in the last row, but your best interest is to get trough the initial phase to be able to concentrate on the quality of the movements. The real fun will start when you will be able to progress with weights and endurance.</p>
